	Defining an Access List

	Every access list definition must begin with an aclname and acltype,
	followed by either type-specific arguments or a quoted filename that
	they are read from.

	   acl aclname acltype argument ...
	   acl aclname acltype "file" ...

	When using "file", the file should contain one item per line.


	ACL Options

	Some acl types supports options which changes their default behaviour:

	-i,+i	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE. To make them
		case-insensitive, use the -i option. To return case-sensitive
		use the +i option between patterns, or make a new ACL line
		without -i.

	-n	Disable lookups and address type conversions.  If lookup or
		conversion is required because the parameter type (IP or
		domain name) does not match the message address type (domain
		name or IP), then the ACL would immediately declare a mismatch
		without any warnings or lookups.

	-m[=delimiters]
		Perform a list membership test, interpreting values as
		comma-separated token lists and matching against individual
		tokens instead of whole values.
		The optional "delimiters" parameter specifies one or more
		alternative non-alphanumeric delimiter characters.
		non-alphanumeric delimiter characters.

	--	Used to stop processing all options, in the case the first acl
		value has '-' character as first character (for example the '-'
		is a valid domain name)

	Some acl types require suspending the current request in order
	to access some external data source.
	Those which do are marked with the tag [slow], those which
	don't are marked as [fast].
	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl

	  # It works on Linux, Solaris, Windows, FreeBSD, and some other
	  # BSD variants.
	  #
	  # The eui_lookup directive is required to be 'on' (the default)
	  # and Squid built with --enable-eui for MAC/EUI addresses to be
	  # available for this ACL.
	  #
	  # Squid can only determine the MAC/EUI address for IPv4
	  # clients that are on the same subnet. If the client is on a
	  # different subnet, then Squid cannot find out its address.
	  #
	  # IPv6 protocol does not contain ARP. MAC/EUI is either
	  # encoded directly in the IPv6 address or not available.

	  #
	  # The client, various intermediaries, and Squid itself may set
	  # CONNMARK at various times. The last CONNMARK set wins. This ACL
	  # checks the mark present on an accepted connection or set by

	  # If -s is specified the limit is strict, denying browsing

	  # -s Squid will just annoy the user by "randomly" denying requests.
	  # (the counter is reset each time the limit is reached and a
	  # request is denied)
	  # NOTE: in acceleration mode or where there is mesh of child proxies,
	  # clients may appear to come from multiple addresses if they are
	  # going through proxy farms, so a limit of 1 may cause user problems.

	acl aclname random probability
	  # Pseudo-randomly match requests. Based on the probability given.

	acl aclname rep_mime_type [-i] mime-type ...
	  # regex match against the mime type of the reply received by

	  # http_reply_access.

	acl aclname note [-m[=delimiters]] name [value ...]
	  # match transaction annotation [fast]
	  # Without values, matches any annotation with a given name.
	  # With value(s), matches any annotation with a given name that
	  # also has one of the given values.
	  # If the -m flag is used, then the value of the named
	  # annotation is interpreted as a list of tokens, and the ACL
	  # matches individual name=token pairs rather than whole
	  # name=value pairs. See "ACL Options" above for more info.
	  # Annotation sources include note and adaptation_meta directives
	  # as well as helper and eCAP responses.

	acl aclname annotate_transaction [-m[=delimiters]] key=value ...
	acl aclname annotate_transaction [-m[=delimiters]] key+=value ...
	  # Always matches. [fast]
	  # Used for its side effect: This ACL immediately adds a
	  # key=value annotation to the current master transaction.
	  # The added annotation can then be tested using note ACL and
	  # logged (or sent to helpers) using %note format code.
	  #
	  # Annotations can be specified using replacement and addition
	  # formats. The key=value form replaces old same-key annotation
	  # value(s). The key+=value form appends a new value to the old
	  # same-key annotation. Both forms create a new key=value
	  # annotation if no same-key annotation exists already. If
	  # -m flag is used, then the value is interpreted as a list
	  # and the annotation will contain key=token pair(s) instead of the
	  # whole key=value pair.
	  #
	  # This ACL is especially useful for recording complex multi-step
	  # ACL-driven decisions. For example, the following configuration
	  # avoids logging transactions accepted after aclX matched:
	  #
	  #  # First, mark transactions accepted after aclX matched
	  #  acl markSpecial annotate_transaction special=true
	  #  http_access allow acl001
	  #  ...
	  #  http_access deny acl100
	  #  http_access allow aclX markSpecial
	  #
	  #  # Second, do not log marked transactions:
	  #  acl markedSpecial note special true
	  #  access_log ... deny markedSpecial
	  #
	  #  # Note that the following would not have worked because aclX
	  #  # alone does not determine whether the transaction was allowed:
	  #  access_log ... deny aclX # Wrong!
	  #
	  # Warning: This ACL annotates the transaction even when negated
	  # and even if subsequent ACLs fail to match. For example, the
	  # following three rules will have exactly the same effect as far
	  # as annotations set by the "mark" ACL are concerned:
	  #
	  #  some_directive acl1 ... mark # rule matches if mark is reached
	  #  some_directive acl1 ... !mark     # rule never matches
	  #  some_directive acl1 ... mark !all # rule never matches

	acl aclname annotate_client [-m[=delimiters]] key=value ...
	acl aclname annotate_client [-m[=delimiters]] key+=value ...
	  #
	  # Always matches. [fast]
	  # Used for its side effect: This ACL immediately adds a
	  # key=value annotation to the current client-to-Squid
	  # connection. Connection annotations are propagated to the current
	  # and all future master transactions on the annotated connection.
	  # See the annotate_transaction ACL for details.
	  #
	  # For example, the following configuration avoids rewriting URLs
	  # of transactions bumped by SslBump:
	  #
	  #  # First, mark bumped connections:
	  #  acl markBumped annotate_client bumped=true
	  #  ssl_bump peek acl1
	  #  ssl_bump stare acl2
	  #  ssl_bump bump acl3 markBumped
	  #  ssl_bump splice all
	  #
	  #  # Second, do not send marked transactions to the redirector:
	  #  acl markedBumped note bumped true
	  #  url_rewrite_access deny markedBumped
	  #
	  #  # Note that the following would not have worked because acl3 alone
	  #  # does not determine whether the connection is going to be bumped:
	  #  url_rewrite_access deny acl3 # Wrong!

	acl aclname adaptation_service service ...
	  # Matches the name of any icap_service, ecap_service,
	  # adaptation_service_set, or adaptation_service_chain that Squid
	  # has used (or attempted to use) for the master transaction.
	  # This ACL must be defined after the corresponding adaptation
	  # service is named in squid.conf. This ACL is usable with
	  # adaptation_meta because it starts matching immediately after
	  # the service has been selected for adaptation.

	acl aclname transaction_initiator initiator ...
	  # Matches transaction's initiator [fast]
	  #
	  # Supported initiators are:
	  #  esi: matches transactions fetching ESI resources
	  #  certificate-fetching: matches transactions fetching
	  #     a missing intermediate TLS certificate
	  #  cache-digest: matches transactions fetching Cache Digests
	  #     from a cache_peer
	  #  htcp: matches HTCP requests from peers
	  #  icp: matches ICP requests to peers
	  #  icmp: matches ICMP RTT database (NetDB) requests to peers
	  #  asn: matches asns db requests
	  #  internal: matches any of the above
	  #  client: matches transactions containing an HTTP or FTP
	  #     client request received at a Squid *_port
	  #  all: matches any transaction, including internal transactions
	  #     without a configurable initiator and hopefully rare
	  #     transactions without a known-to-Squid initiator
	  #
	  # Multiple initiators are ORed.

	acl aclname has component
	  # matches a transaction "component" [fast]
	  #
	  # Supported transaction components are:
	  #  request: transaction has a request header (at least)
	  #  response: transaction has a response header (at least)
	  #  ALE: transaction has an internally-generated Access Log Entry
	  #       structure; bugs notwithstanding, all transaction have it
	  #
	  # For example, the following configuration helps when dealing with HTTP
	  # clients that close connections without sending a request header:
	  #
	  #  acl hasRequest has request
	  #  acl logMe note important_transaction
	  #  # avoid "logMe ACL is used in context without an HTTP request" warnings
	  #  access_log ... logformat=detailed hasRequest logMe
	  #  # log request-less transactions, instead of ignoring them
	  #  access_log ... logformat=brief !hasRequest
	  #
	  # Multiple components are not supported for one "acl" rule, but
	  # can be specified (and are ORed) using multiple same-name rules:
	  #
	  #  # OK, this strange logging daemon needs request or response,
	  #  # but can work without either a request or a response:
	  #  acl hasWhatMyLoggingDaemonNeeds has request
	  #  acl hasWhatMyLoggingDaemonNeeds has response

acl aclname at_step step
	  # match against the current request processing step [fast]
	  # Valid steps are:
	  #   GeneratingCONNECT: Generating HTTP CONNECT request headers
IF USE_OPENSSL
	  # The following ssl_bump processing steps are recognized:
	  #   SslBump1: After getting TCP-level and HTTP CONNECT info.
	  #   SslBump2: After getting SSL Client Hello info.
	  #   SslBump3: After getting SSL Server Hello info.
ENDIF

IF USE_OPENSSL
	acl aclname ssl_error errorname
	  # match against SSL certificate validation error [fast]
	  #
	  # For valid error names see in /usr/local/squid/share/errors/templates/error-details.txt
	  # template file.
	  #
	  # The following can be used as shortcuts for certificate properties:
	  #  [ssl::]certHasExpired: the "not after" field is in the past
	  #  [ssl::]certNotYetValid: the "not before" field is in the future
	  #  [ssl::]certUntrusted: The certificate issuer is not to be trusted.
	  #  [ssl::]certSelfSigned: The certificate is self signed.
	  #  [ssl::]certDomainMismatch: The certificate CN domain does not
	  #         match the name the name of the host we are connecting to.
	  #
	  # The ssl::certHasExpired, ssl::certNotYetValid, ssl::certDomainMismatch,
	  # ssl::certUntrusted, and ssl::certSelfSigned can also be used as
	  # predefined ACLs, just like the 'all' ACL.
	  #
	  # NOTE: The ssl_error ACL is only supported with sslproxy_cert_error,
	  # sslproxy_cert_sign, and sslproxy_cert_adapt options.

	acl aclname server_cert_fingerprint [-sha1] fingerprint
	  # match against server SSL certificate fingerprint [fast]
	  #
	  # The fingerprint is the digest of the DER encoded version
	  # of the whole certificate. The user should use the form: XX:XX:...
	  # Optional argument specifies the digest algorithm to use.
	  # The SHA1 digest algorithm is the default and is currently
	  # the only algorithm supported (-sha1).

	acl aclname ssl::server_name [option] .foo.com ...
	  # matches server name obtained from various sources [fast]
	  #
	  # The ACL computes server name(s) using such information sources as
	  # CONNECT request URI, TLS client SNI, and TLS server certificate
	  # subject (CN and SubjectAltName). The computed server name(s) usually
	  # change with each SslBump step, as more info becomes available:
	  # * SNI is used as the server name instead of the request URI,
	  # * subject name(s) from the server certificate (CN and
	  #   SubjectAltName) are used as the server names instead of SNI.
	  #
	  # When the ACL computes multiple server names, matching any single
	  # computed name is sufficient for the ACL to match.
	  #
	  # The "none" name can be used to match transactions where the ACL
	  # could not compute the server name using any information source
	  # that was both available and allowed to be used by the ACL options at
	  # the ACL evaluation time.
	  #
	  # Unlike dstdomain, this ACL does not perform DNS lookups.
	  #
	  # An ACL option below may be used to restrict what information
	  # sources are used to extract the server names from:
	  #
	  # --client-requested
	  #   The server name is SNI regardless of what the server says.
	  # --server-provided
	  #   The server name(s) are the certificate subject name(s), regardless
	  #   of what the client has requested. If the server certificate is
	  #   unavailable, then the name is "none".
	  # --consensus
	  #   The server name is either SNI (if SNI matches at least one of the
	  #   certificate subject names) or "none" (otherwise). When the server
	  #   certificate is unavailable, the consensus server name is SNI.

	  #
	  # The master transaction deals with HTTP messages received from
	  # various sources. All sources used by the master transaction in the
	  # past are considered by the ACL. The following rules define whether
	  # a given message source taints the entire master transaction,
	  # resulting in ACL mismatches:
	  #
	  #  * The HTTP client transport connection is not TLS.
	  #  * An adaptation service connection-encryption flag is off.
	  #  * The peer or origin server transport connection is not TLS.
	  #
	  # Caching currently does not affect these rules. This cache ignorance
	  # implies that only the current HTTP client transport and REQMOD
	  # services status determine whether this ACL matches a from-cache
	  # transaction. The source of the cached response does not have any
	  # effect on future transaction that use the cached response without
	  # revalidation. This may change.
	  #
	  # DNS, ICP, and HTCP exchanges during the master transaction do not
	  # affect these rules.

	  # ACLs from multiple any-of lines with the same name are ORed.
	  # For example, A = (a1 or a2) or (a3 or a4) can be written as

	  #   acl A any-of a3 a4

	  # This group ACL is fast if all evaluated ACLs in the group are fast
