	Defines a single ICAP service using the following format:

	icap_service id vectoring_point uri [option ...]

	id: ID
		an opaque identifier or name which is used to direct traffic to
		this specific service. Must be unique among all adaptation
		services in squid.conf.

	vectoring_point: reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
		ICAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
		are not yet supported.

	uri: icap://servername:port/servicepath
		ICAP server and service location.
	     icaps://servername:port/servicepath
		The "icap:" URI scheme is used for traditional ICAP server and
		service location (default port is 1344, connections are not
		encrypted). The "icaps:" URI scheme is for Secure ICAP
		services that use SSL/TLS-encrypted ICAP connections (by
		default, on port 11344).

	ICAP does not allow a single service to handle both REQMOD and RESPMOD
	transactions. Squid does not enforce that requirement. You can specify
	services with the same service_url and different vectoring_points. You
	can even specify multiple identical services as long as their
	service_names differ.

	To activate a service, use the adaptation_access directive. To group
	services, use adaptation_service_chain and adaptation_service_set.

	Service options are separated by white space. ICAP services support
	the following name=value options:

	bypass=on|off|1|0
		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is treated as
		optional. If the service cannot be reached or malfunctions,
		Squid will try to ignore any errors and process the message as
		if the service was not enabled. No all ICAP errors can be
		bypassed.  If set to 0, the ICAP service is treated as
		essential and all ICAP errors will result in an error page
		returned to the HTTP client.

		Bypass is off by default: services are treated as essential.

	routing=on|off|1|0
		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is allowed to
		dynamically change the current message adaptation plan by
		returning a chain of services to be used next. The services
		are specified using the X-Next-Services ICAP response header
		value, formatted as a comma-separated list of service names.
		Each named service should be configured in squid.conf. Other
		services are ignored. An empty X-Next-Services value results
		in an empty plan which ends the current adaptation.

		Dynamic adaptation plan may cross or cover multiple supported
		vectoring points in their natural processing order.

		Routing is not allowed by default: the ICAP X-Next-Services
		response header is ignored.

	ipv6=on|off
		Only has effect on split-stack systems. The default on those systems
		is to use IPv4-only connections. When set to 'on' this option will
		make Squid use IPv6-only connections to contact this ICAP service.

	on-overload=block|bypass|wait|force
		If the service Max-Connections limit has been reached, do
		one of the following for each new ICAP transaction:
		  * block:  send an HTTP error response to the client
		  * bypass: ignore the "over-connected" ICAP service
		  * wait:   wait (in a FIFO queue) for an ICAP connection slot
		  * force:  proceed, ignoring the Max-Connections limit

		In SMP mode with N workers, each worker assumes the service
		connection limit is Max-Connections/N, even though not all
		workers may use a given service.

		The default value is "bypass" if service is bypassable,
		otherwise it is set to "wait".


	max-conn=number
		Use the given number as the Max-Connections limit, regardless
		of the Max-Connections value given by the service, if any.

	connection-encryption=on|off
		Determines the ICAP service effect on the connections_encrypted
		ACL.

		The default is "on" for Secure ICAP services (i.e., those
		with the icaps:// service URIs scheme) and "off" for plain ICAP
		services.

		Does not affect ICAP connections (e.g., does not turn Secure
		ICAP on or off).

	==== ICAPS / TLS OPTIONS ====

	These options are used for Secure ICAP (icaps://....) services only.

	tls-cert=/path/to/ssl/certificate
			A client X.509 certificate to use when connecting to
			this ICAP server.

	tls-key=/path/to/ssl/key
			The private key corresponding to the previous
			tls-cert= option.

			If tls-key= is not specified tls-cert= is assumed to
			reference a PEM file containing both the certificate
			and private key.

	tls-cipher=...	The list of valid TLS/SSL ciphers to use when connecting
			to this icap server.

	tls-min-version=1.N
			The minimum TLS protocol version to permit. To control
			SSLv3 use the tls-options= parameter.
			Supported Values: 1.0 (default), 1.1, 1.2

	tls-options=...	Specify various OpenSSL library options:

			    NO_SSLv3    Disallow the use of SSLv3

			    SINGLE_DH_USE
				      Always create a new key when using
				      temporary/ephemeral DH key exchanges

			    ALL       Enable various bug workarounds
				      suggested as "harmless" by OpenSSL
				      Be warned that this reduces SSL/TLS
				      strength to some attacks.

			See the OpenSSL SSL_CTX_set_options documentation for a
			more complete list. Options relevant only to SSLv2 are
			not supported.

	tls-cafile=	PEM file containing CA certificates to use when verifying
			the icap server certificate.
			Use to specify intermediate CA certificate(s) if not sent
			by the server. Or the full CA chain for the server when
			using the tls-default-ca=off flag.
			May be repeated to load multiple files.

	tls-capath=...	A directory containing additional CA certificates to
			use when verifying the icap server certificate.
			Requires OpenSSL or LibreSSL.

	tls-crlfile=...	A certificate revocation list file to use when
			verifying the icap server certificate.

	tls-flags=...	Specify various flags modifying the Squid TLS implementation:

			DONT_VERIFY_PEER
				Accept certificates even if they fail to
				verify.
			DONT_VERIFY_DOMAIN
				Don't verify the icap server certificate
				matches the server name

	tls-default-ca[=off]
			Whether to use the system Trusted CAs. Default is ON.

	tls-domain=	The icap server name as advertised in it's certificate.
			Used for verifying the correctness of the received icap
			server certificate. If not specified the icap server
			hostname extracted from ICAP URI will be used.

	Older icap_service format without optional named parameters is
	deprecated but supported for backward compatibility.

Example:
icap_service svcBlocker reqmod_precache icap://icap1.mydomain.net:1344/reqmod bypass=0
icap_service svcLogger reqmod_precache icaps://icap2.mydomain.net:11344/reqmod routing=on
